## Redirection & Pipelines

```bash
# Overwrite the file `<file_name>` with the string "<content>" (creates the file if it doesn't exist)
echo "<content>" > <file_name>

# Append the string "<content>" to the end of the file `<file_name>` (creates the file if it doesn't exist)
echo "<content>" >> <file_name>

# Redirect standard output (stdout) of the `ls` command to the file `<output_file>`
ls -l <directory> 1> <output_file>

# Redirect standard error (stderr) of the `ls` command to the file `<error_file>`
ls -l <directory> 2> <error_file>

# Redirect both standard output and standard error to the file `<output_file>`
ls -l <directory &> <output_file>

# Discard both standard output and standard error by redirecting to `/dev/null`
ls -l <directory> &> /dev/null
```

A pipeline `(|)` connects the output of one command to the input of another, enabling efficient data processing in a chain of commands.

```bash
# Example 1: Pipe the output of `ls` to `grep` to filter results containing "<pattern>"
ls | grep "<pattern>"

# Example 2: Pipe the output of `ps` to `grep` to find a specific process
ps aux | grep "<process_name>"

# Example 3: Count the number of lines in a file using `wc -l`
cat <file_name> | wc -l

# Example 4: Use `cut` to extract specific columns from a file, and then sort the output
cat <file.csv> | cut -d ',' -f 1 | sort

# Example 5: Chain multiple commands to extract and manipulate data
cat <log_file> | grep "<keyword>" | awk '{print $1, $2, $3}' | sort | uniq
```

## Finding Files & Directories

`find` doesn't use an index and searches the file system in real time

```bash
# Find all files and directories in the current directory
find .

# Find a file by name in the current directory
find . -name <file>

# Find all CSV files in the current directory
find . -type f -name '*.csv'

# Find files by case-insensitive name pattern in the current directory
find . -type f -iname "*<file>*"

# Find a file by name in a given directory
find <directory> -name <file>

# Find files with a specific extension in a given directory
find <directory> -name "*.<extension_type>"

# Find all files in a given directory
find <directory> -type f

# Find all directories in a given directory
find <directory> -type d

# Find all symbolic links in a given directory
find <directory> -type l

# Find files by case-insensitive name pattern in a given directory
find <directory> -type f -iname "*<file>*"

# Find all directories containing "proj" in a given directory
find <directory> -type d -name "*proj*"

# mmin = modified minutes
# mtime = modified time (days)
# cmin = changed minutes
# ctime = changed time (days)
# amin = accessed minutes
# atime = accessed time (days)

# Find files modified within the last 24 hours (1 day) in the current directory
find . -type f -mtime 0

# Find files modified within the last 10 minutes in the current directory
find . -type f -mmin -10

# Find files modified more than 10 minutes ago in the current directory
find . -type f -mmin +10

# Find files modified between 1 and 5 minutes ago in the current directory
find . -type f -mmin +1 -mmin -5

# Find files modified within the last 20 days in a given directory
find <directory> -type f -mtime -20

# Find files modified more than 20 days ago in a given directory
find <directory> -type f -mtime +20

# Find files modified within the last 48 hours in a given directory
find <directory> -type f -newermt '48 hours ago'

# Find files modified within the last 30 days in a given directory
find <directory> -type f -newermt '30 days ago'

# Find files modified within the last 5 minutes in a given directory
find <directory> -type f -newermt '5 minutes ago'

# Find all files in /var/ that were modified within the last 24 hours (-mtime 0) and copy the files to /home/user/directory
sudo find /var/ -type f -mtime 0 -exec cp {} /home/user/directory \;

# Find files larger than 300 bytes in the current directory
find . -type f -size +300c

# Find files exactly 4KB in size in a given directory
find <directory> -type f -size 4k

# Find files larger than 5MB in the current directory
find . -type f -size +5M

# Find files less than 1GB in the current directory
find . type f -size -1G

# Find files between 75MB and 100MB in a given directory
find <directory> -type f -size -100M -size +75M

# Find files with read, write, and execute permissions in the current directory
find . -type f -perm 777

# Find files and directories where 'other' has exactly read / write permissions in the current directory
# -perm '-' means match exact permissions
find . -perm -o=rx

# Find files and directories where 'other' has at least read / write permissions in a given directory
# -perm '/' means at least the specified permissions
find <directory> -perm /o=rx

# Find files and directories where 'other' does not have read,write and execute permissions in the current directory
# -perm '/' means at least the specified permissions
find . -not -perm /o=rwx

# Find and delete all files matching the criteria in a given directory without recursing into subdirectories
find <directory> -maxdepth 1 -type f -name "*.<extension_type>" -exec rm -f {} \;
```

`plocate` is a faster, more efficient implementation of locate, which is used to find files on a Linux system by querying a prebuilt index.

```bash
# Since plocate is not installed by default on most systems, you can install it as follows:

# On Debian/Ubuntu-based systems
sudo apt install plocate

# On Fedora-based systems
sudo dnf install plocate

# Search for a file by its name
plocate <filename>

# Search for all files with a .txt extension using a wildcard
plocate "*.txt"

# Limit the number of search results to 10 when searching for a specific file
plocate -n 10 <filename>

# Use regular expression to search for files matching the criteria in the /home/user directory
plocate -r '^/home/user/.*filename'

# Update the plocate database to ensure new or deleted files are reflected in future searches
sudo updatedb
```

## Scheduled Tasks

### cron

`cron` is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. It enables users to schedule scripts or commands to run automatically at specified intervals or times. The scheduled jobs are known as "cron jobs."

```bash
# List the current user's crontab entries
crontab -l

# Edit the current user's crontab using the default file editor
crontab -e

# Load a crontab from a specified file
crontab /path/to/crontab

# Save the current crontab entries to a specified file
crontab -l > /path/to/crontab

# Remove the current user's crontab (deletes all scheduled jobs)
crontab -r

# EXAMPLES

# Run the command every minute
* * * * * <command>

# Run the command every 15 minutes
*/15 * * * * <command>

# Run the command every hour at the start of the hour
0 * * * * <command>

# Run the command daily at 6:15 AM
15 6 * * * <command>

# Run the command every Friday at 4:44 AM
44 4 * * 5 <command>

# Run the command at midnight on the first day of every month
0 0 1 * * <command>

# Run the command at midnight on January 1st every year
0 0 1 1 * <command>
```

### at

`at` is used for scheduling one-time tasks to run at a specific time in the future. It is suitable for tasks that do not recur and need to be executed only once.

```bash
# Schedule a job to run at a specific time (2:00 PM today)
echo "sh /path/to/script.sh" | at 14:00

# Schedule a job to run at a specific time on the next day (8:00 AM tomorrow)
echo "sh /path/to/script.sh" | at 8:00 AM tomorrow

# Schedule a job to run after a relative time (1 hour from now)
echo "sh /path/to/script.sh" | at now + 1 hour

# List all scheduled one-time tasks (shows job numbers and scheduled times)
atq

# Remove a scheduled job by its job number (e.g., job number 5)
atrm 5

# List all scheduled one-time tasks (alternative to atq)
at -l

# Display the details of a specific scheduled job by its ID
at -c 1

# Remove a scheduled task by its ID
at -r 1
```

### anacron

`anacron` is used for scheduling recurring jobs on systems that may not be running continuously, unlike cron. It ensures jobs run after the system is restarted, even if they were missed.

`anacron` uses a configuration file, typically located at **/etc/anacrontab**, to define scheduled jobs. The syntax is different from cron and does not specify exact times. Instead, it specifies the number of days between job executions and the delay after the system starts.

- **period:** Number of days between job executions (e.g., 1 for daily, 7 for weekly).
- **delay:** Delay (in minutes) before running the job after the system starts.
- **job_identifier:** A unique name for the job (used for logging purposes).
- **command:** The command or script to run.

```bash
# Edit the anacrontab file (system-wide configuration for anacron jobs)
sudo nano /etc/anacrontab

# Example anacron job entries (format: period delay identifier command)

# Run a daily backup job with a 5-minute delay after system startup
1 5 daily_backup /path/to/backup_script.sh

# Run a weekly log cleanup job with a 10-minute delay after system startup
7 10 weekly_log_cleanup /path/to/log_cleanup.sh

# Run a monthly report generation job with a 15-minute delay after system startup
30 15 monthly_report /path/to/report_script.sh
```

## Terminal Multiplexers

Tmux is terminal multiplexer that allows multiple terminal sessions to be accessed simultaneously in a single window. It enables users to run multiple command-line programs concurrently and detach processes from their controlling terminals, allowing remote sessions to remain active without being visible.

Here’s a handy table of the default **tmux** keyboard shortcuts to reference. These shortcuts assume the default prefix is `Ctrl+b`.

## Secure Shell Protocol (SSH)

```bash
# Connect to a remote host using the current username and the default SSH port (22)
ssh <hostname>

# Connect to a remote host using an identity file (private key) for authentication
ssh -i <path_to_key> <hostname>

# Connect to a remote host with a specified username over the default SSH port (22)
ssh <user>@<hostname>

# Connect to a remote host with a specified username over a custom port (e.g., 2222)
ssh <user>@<hostname> -p 2222

# Connect to a remote host using an identity file, specifying a custom port, and enabling verbose output (useful for debugging)
ssh -i <path_to_key> <user>@<host> -p 2222 -v

# Generate a new SSH key pair using the Ed25519 algorithm with an optional comment (e.g., your email)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C <email>

# Start the SSH agent (required to add keys for authentication)
eval "$(ssh-agent)"

# Add the private key to the SSH agent for authentication
ssh-add ~/.ssh/<key>

# Copy the public key to the remote host for passwordless login
ssh-copy-id -i <path_to_key> -p 2222 <user>@<host>

# Start the SSH daemon (sshd) to allow incoming SSH connections
systemctl start sshd

# Restart the SSH daemon (useful after changing configuration)
systemctl restart sshd

# Stop the SSH daemon (disables SSH access to the system)
systemctl stop sshd

# Check the status of the SSH daemon
systemctl status sshd

# Display the system journal logs for the SSH service (shows logs specific to the sshd unit)
journalctl -u ssh
```

Set default user and port in `~/.ssh/config`, so you can just enter the name next time:

```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
Host name
  User <username>
  Hostname <hostname>
  Port <port>
$ ssh name
```

## Secure Copy (SCP)

```bash
# Copy a local file to a remote directory
scp /path/to/local/file <username>@<remote_host>:/path/to/remote/directory

# Copy a file from a remote host to a local directory
scp <username>@<remote_host>:/path/to/remote/file /path/to/local/directory

# Recursively copy an entire local directory to a remote directory
scp -r /path/to/local/directory <username>@<remote_host>:/path/to/remote/directory
# Copy a local file to a remote directory over a custom port (e.g., port 2222)
scp -P 2222 /path/to/local/file <username>@<remote_host>:/path/to/remote/directory

# Copy a local file to a remote directory using a specific private key for authentication
scp -P 2222 -i ~/.ssh/private_key /path/to/local/file <username>@<remote_host>:/path/to/remote/directory

# Limit the bandwidth usage for the file transfer to 1000 Kbps (useful for large files on limited networks)
scp -l 1000 /path/to/local/file <username>@<remote_host>:/path/to/remote/directory

# Enable compression for faster file transfer (useful for transferring large text files or data over slow networks)
scp -C /path/to/local/file <username>@<remote_host>:/path/to/remote/directory
# Preserve file attributes (e.g., modification time, access time, and permissions) during transfer
scp -p /path/to/local/file <username>@<remote_host>:/path/to/remote/directory

# Show the progress of the file transfer in real-time
scp -v /path/to/local/file <username>@<remote_host>:/path/to/remote/directory

# Combine multiple options: recursive copy with compression and progress display
scp -r -C -v /path/to/local/directory <username>@<remote_host>:/path/to/remote/directory

## Rsync

```bash
# Synchronise files and directories from a local source to a local destination with archive mode (-a), compression (-z), and verbose output (-v)
rsync -avz /path/to/source/ /path/to/destination/

# Synchronise files and directories from a local source to a remote destination over SSH with archive mode, compression, and verbose output
rsync -avz /path/to/local/files <username>@<remote.server>:/path/to/remote/directory/

# Perform a dry-run (no actual changes) of synchronising files over SSH using a specific private key and port, showing what would be copied
rsync -avzh -e "ssh -i .ssh/<key> -p <port_num>" --dry-run /path/to/local/files <username>@<remote.server>:/path/to/remote/directory/

# Perform a dry-run and delete extraneous files from the destination that are no longer present in the source (--delete option)
rsync -avzh -e "ssh -i .ssh/<key> -p <port_num>" --delete --dry-run /path/to/local/files <username>@<remote.server>:/path/to/remote/directory/

# Synchronise a local directory to a USB drive, preserving file attributes
rsync -avz /home/user/documents/ /media/usb_drive/

# Create an incremental backup using hard links (--link-dest) to avoid copying unchanged files from a previous backup
rsync -avz --link-dest=/previous/backup/ /home/user/ /current/backup/

# Synchronise a local directory while excluding specific directories or files (--exclude option)
rsync -avz --exclude "/home/user/documents/" /home/user/ /media/usb_drive/

# Backup a web directory while excluding a temporary directory and appending a date to the backup folder name
rsync -avz --exclude "/var/www/tmp" /var/www/ /mnt/backups/www_$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Copy files or directories with compression (-z) and verbose output (-v)
rsync -zv /file_src /file_dst

# Copy files without overwriting existing files at the destination (--ignore-existing)
rsync -avz --ignore-existing /file_src /file_dst

# Copy a file quickly, only if it has been modified (uses file size and timestamp to detect changes)
rsync -zv /file_src /file_dst
